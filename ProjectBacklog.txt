Problem Statement:
Communication between a physician's office and a patient can be
slow or difficult.  Common queries, such as those associated with
bills, test results, or appointments could easily be answered
automatically.

Background information:
The goal of this software is to allow patients to request appointments
and procedures (with necessary approval from a doctor), and view their
test results, etc.  It will also provide an automatic filing system for
documents associated with a given patient.  This should also minimize the
amount of work that a receptionist must do.
