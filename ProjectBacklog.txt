Problem Statement:
Communication between a physician's office and a patient is
limited and difficult.  Common queries, such as those associated with
bills, test results, or appointments could easily be automated.

Background information:
The goal of this software is to allow patients to request appointments
and procedures (with necessary approval from a doctor), and view their
test results, etc.  It will also provide an automatic filing system for
documents associated with a given patient.  This should also minimize the
amount of work that a receptionist must do.

Non-functional requirements:
-We will need a Dashboard/welcome page to route requests once logged in.
-Encryption/Passwords (time permitting)
-Project will be developed in Django.
-Records and User information will be stored in a database.

Stage 1:
-As a user I would like to be able to log in and log out
-As a doctor I would like to publish a record
-As a secretary I would like to create and view appointments
-As a secretary I would like to add/update patients (like admin)
-As a patient I would like to view my records

Stage 2:
-As a doctor I would like to view my daily calander
-As a patient I would like to request an appointment
-As a secretary I would like to update patient information

Stage 3:
-Patient ties to multiple doctors (i.e. Dermatologist, etc) (time permitting)
