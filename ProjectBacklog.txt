Backlog:

Core:
-As a user I would like to be able to log in and log out
-As a doctor I would like to publish a record
-As a secretary I would like to create and view appointments
-Secretary needs to add/update patients (like admin)
-As a patient I would like to view my records

Next:
-Doctor should view daily calander
-Patient should be able to request appointments
-Secretary should update patient information 

Extras:
-Patient ties to multiple doctors (i.e. Dermatologist, etc)
